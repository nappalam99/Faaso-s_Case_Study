join driver_order as od
on co.order_id = od.order_id)
select order_id,count(roll_id),
   round(sum((case when min_diff is null then 0 else min_diff end))/count((case when roll_id = 1 then 1 else 1 end))) as count_roll_id
from cte 
group by order_id
order by order_id

12. What was the average distance travelled for each customer ?

with cte as(select 
order_id,
substring(duration from 1 for 2):: int as new_duration 
from driver_order)
select 
(max(new_duration)over()- min(new_duration)over()) as diff_in_interval
from cte
limit 1

14. What was the average speed for each driver for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

with cte as (select
order_id,driver_id,
substring(distance from 1 for 2)::numeric as new_distance,
substring(duration from 1 for 2)::numeric as new_duration
from driver_order
where distance is not null and duration is not null)
select driver_id,round(avg((new_distance/new_duration)*60)) as avg_delivery_time_per_hour
from cte
group by driver_id
order by driver_id

trend the person who had driver_id 3 is a faster deliver
